# CC CRM Frontend

## Overview
 This website was developed to be Complete Compliance's new CRM
 
## Installation & Running

1. Run install all the app with `yarn`

2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a file called `.env` and replace the variables

3. You can run the app with `yarn start`

## Deployment

We use **Netlify** free plan CI to deploy the application whenever a new change is pushed to the master branch. Please only push features tested and completed, since we use free CI, so there is limit to how many time CIs can be run.

Is highly recommended that you do your work in a different branch, and after everything is completed and tested, you create a PR for the master branch.
